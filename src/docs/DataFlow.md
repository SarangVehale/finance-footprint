# Data Flow Documentation

## Overview
The Finance Footprint application uses a combination of local storage persistence and React state management to handle data flow throughout the application.

## Storage Service

The core data layer is the `storageService` which provides methods for:

- Persisting data to localStorage
- Retrieving data from localStorage
- Performing CRUD operations on transactions, notes, and settings

### Key Methods

```typescript
// Transactions
getTransactions(): Transaction[]
saveTransaction(transaction: Transaction): void
updateTransaction(transaction: Transaction): void
deleteTransaction(id: string): void

// Notes
getNotes(): Note[]
saveNote(note: Note): void
updateNote(note: Note): void
deleteNote(id: string): void

// Settings
getCurrency(): string
setCurrency(currency: string): void
getCategories(): TransactionCategory[]
setCategories(categories: TransactionCategory[]): void
```

## Component Data Flow

### Input → Processing → Output Pattern

1. **Input**: User actions (adding transaction, filtering data)
2. **Processing**: State updates and localStorage operations
3. **Output**: UI updates reflecting the new state

### Data Flow Example: Adding a Transaction

```
User action (Add Transaction)
↓
Component state update (amount, category, description)
↓
Form validation
↓
storageService.saveTransaction()
↓
localStorage update
↓
Refresh transaction list (useState/useEffect)
↓
UI update with new transaction
```

## State Management

The application uses a combination of:

- **Local Component State**: For UI controls and form inputs
- **Lifted State**: For sharing data between related components
- **localStorage**: For persistence between sessions
- **React Query**: For more complex data operations with caching

### State Management Patterns

1. **Form State**: Controlled inputs with React state
2. **Filtered Data**: Derived state using useMemo
3. **Shared State**: Lifting state up to common parent
4. **Persistent State**: Syncing with localStorage

## Data Optimization

- **Memoization**: Using useMemo to avoid expensive recalculations
- **Batched Updates**: Processing data in batches where possible
- **Lazy Loading**: Loading data when needed, not upfront

## Best Practices

- Keep related state together
- Use lifting state up instead of prop drilling
- Leverage useMemo for expensive calculations
- Always synchronize UI state with localStorage where needed
- Use React Query for more complex data requirements

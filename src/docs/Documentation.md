## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

### Storage Access Issues

**Symptoms**: Data not being saved, errors when adding transactions or notes

**Solutions**:
1. Check browser storage permissions
2. Clear browser cache and refresh
3. Check for localStorage availability
4. Use incognito/private browsing mode to reset permissions

### UI Display Issues

**Symptoms**: Elements overlapping, content not visible, keyboard issues

**Solutions**:
1. Check device orientation and screen size
2. Verify CSS styles for responsive design
3. Inspect element placement with browser dev tools
4. Test on different devices or screen sizes

## Security Considerations

Finance Footprint uses localStorage for data persistence, which has some security implications:

1. **Data Scope**: Data is stored only on the user's device
2. **Browser Access**: Data is accessible to any JavaScript running on the same domain
3. **Clearing Data**: Clearing browser cache/cookies will delete all stored data

General recommendations for users:
1. Avoid storing extremely sensitive financial information
2. Use device passcode/password protection
3. Clear browser data when using shared devices
4. Consider using the PWA install option for better isolation

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow functional component patterns
- Use hooks for state management
- Keep components small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic

### State Management

The application uses local storage for data persistence with a simple service layer:

- `localStorage.ts` handles all data operations
- Data is stored in the browser's localStorage
- Automatic data persistence
- Type-safe operations

### Mobile Development

The application is built with Capacitor for native mobile functionality:

1. Build the web application
2. Sync with Capacitor
3. Open in Xcode/Android Studio
4. Build and run on device/simulator

## Debugging

### Common Issues

1. Storage Issues:
   - Clear localStorage if data becomes corrupted
   - Check browser storage limits

2. Mobile Development:
   - Ensure Capacitor is properly synchronized
   - Check platform-specific logs
   - Use browser dev tools for web debugging

### Development Tools

- Browser DevTools for web debugging
- Xcode/Android Studio for native debugging
- React DevTools for component inspection
